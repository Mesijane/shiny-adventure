	- Take a look at datasets in [UCL](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)
	- Pick one dataset which interests you
	- Aim is to write a script which will automatically download the data add the labels.
	- We can then think of a way to make this robust to download any data from this website and add labels
